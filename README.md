# Trail Manager
A simple, small program that simulates a program like Maps or Strava which locates various landmarks (provided via text file) based on a list of trails. It uses a graph structure in order to implement this, where landmarks are nodes and trails are edges.
The UI was not done by me, but the Java implementation of the underlying system and the logic of it was completed by me.
